## INSTALLATION

With vim-plug:

```
Plug 'kyoh86/vim-editerm'
```

## CONFIGURATION

Put below lines in `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`.

```
if [[ -n "${VIM_TERMINAL}" ]]; then
  function vim() {
    ${EDITOR} "$@"
  }
fi
```

## USAGE

Without being conscious.

In `:terminal`, you can `git commit` in buffer in the parent vim.
If you want to stop editing with the error (i.e. to stop to commit), call `:Cq` or `:CQ`.
