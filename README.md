## INSTALLATION

With vim-plug:

```
Plug 'kyoh86/vim-editerm'
```

And put below lines in `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`.

```
if [[ "${VIM_EDITERM_SETUP}" != "" ]]; then
  source "${VIM_EDITERM_SETUP}"
fi
```

## USAGE

Without being conscious.

In `:terminal`, you can `git commit` in buffer in the parent vim.

If you want to stop editing with the error (i.e. to stop to commit), call `:Cq` or `:CQ`.

## CONFIGURATION

### Behavior to open files

We can change behavior to open files.

```vim
let g:editerm_opener = 'n'  " :new <file> (default)
let g:editerm_opener = 'e'  " :edit <file>
let g:editerm_opener = 'v'  " :vnew <file>
let g:editerm_opener = 't'  " :tabnew <file>
```

Or by `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`

```sh
export VIM_EDITERM_OPENER="n"  # :new <file>
export VIM_EDITERM_OPENER="e"  # :edit <file>
export VIM_EDITERM_OPENER="v"  # :vnew <file>
export VIM_EDITERM_OPENER="t"  # :tabnew <file>
```

### Definition of the dropping commands

`vim-editerm` will creates below commands which drops files to vim.

```shell
:drop <files...>
:edit <files...>
:new <files...>
:vnew <files...>
:tabnew <files...>
```

If you want to supress them:

```vim
let g:editerm_defdrop = '0'  " default: '1'
```

And if you want to change prefix of them:

```vim
let g:editerm_defdrop_prefix = 'vim_'  " default: ':'
```
